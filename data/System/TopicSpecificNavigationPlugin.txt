%TOC%

---++ Introduction / Motivation
This plugin introduces a new field to topic, the subnavigation. Every user able to edit the topic, can edit the navigation. He can add links which can be used to refer to 
other topics. The links are added by a UI and its easy to go. This navigation should try to help readers follow up informations or simply "navigate down". You can separate content that way more easily,
and the users always looks at the same place/box to look, where the other parts are, instead of looking for any links in the content-text.

---++ Installation instructions
   * just use the installer attached to the topic or even easier, use the configure-system/Extension to easy install it trough an user-interface

---+++ Configuration
   * Use the Configuration Center ( bin/configure ) to configure the driver you want to use, the DSN and user / password

---+++ Optional: Create table

   1 click [[%SCRIPTURL{"rest"}%/DBConnectorPlugin/createdb?topic=System.WebHome][here]] to create a test table for the System-Web
   1 no you can query the database with update and get queries like described abo
