%TOC%

---++ Introduction / Motivation
This plugin introduces a new data toa topic, the subnavigation. Every user is able to edit this subnavigation. He can add links which can be used to refer to 
other topics, readups or related topics. All links are added using the WYSIWYG Editor. This navigation should try to help readers follow up informations or simply "navigate down" the tree to get to the point they actaully want to. 
You can separate content that way more easily, and the users always can look at the same place/box, where all such links are stored, instead of looking for any links in the content-text ( and missing them ).

---++ Installation instructions
   * just use the installer attached to the topic or even easier, use the configure-system/Extension to easy install it trough an user-interface

__Note:__ You do not need to install anything on the browser to use this Plugin. The following instructions are for the administrator who installs the Plugin on the server where Foswiki is running.

---++ !ToDo
   * Provide UI to insert/edit links
   * provide default template to show links for topics in a box
